About Our Project : 

Our project is a clone of a www.pepperfry.com, where we can purchase home decor and all furniture products.

Guide to Project:

* Continuing to project we have build in unit-2, we have added backend functionalities, i.e we created our own API's and databases. 

* Here we have stored products and users data, which is we are using to show in our webpages.

* In this project we have implemented dynamic functionality which enables users to buy multiple products , and no static data has been used.

* We also improved our Ui/Ux.
 
* We have Implemented Sign Up and Login Functionality where we are storing users details in the mongoose atlas database.

* So this is basically our project. We were three members in the team and we completed the whole project in the construct week timeline.
